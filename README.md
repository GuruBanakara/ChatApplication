chat application using WebSocket api
If you dont know what is WebSocket api,then the WebSocket API is an advanced technology that makes it possible 
to open a two-way interactive communication session between the user's browser and a server.

On running the application as a Spring boot app and accessing http://localhost:8080/ will provide a response 
with an html page where the user will be prompted to enter the username.
After successful submit to the server, the user will be subscribed to a topic and can send messages.
